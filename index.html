   <h1>Project One by the June-ypers</h1>
   <i>June, Fang, Tigist, Christian P., Kyle</i>
    <h2>How Do the Factors of Number of Police, Average Income, Unemployment and School Rating Impact the Safety of a City?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Number of police officers</li>
        <li>School Ratings</li>
        <li>Avg. Unemployment Rate</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Table of Stats</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>fail to reject the null: indicates that our sample did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the effect exists. However, at the same time, the lack of evidence does not prove that an effect does not exist.
<br>
obvious correlations existed such as high numbers of police officers were present where the most crime happened in our cities
so at the surface level it would make sense that ORIs with school ratings and avg incomes in the upper 3rd quartile would have low crime numbers but our data was somewhat scattered
<br>
There is interesting data within our dataframe and datasets. With more time, numerous tests and graphs could be constructed to discover possible correlations but within our context we couldnâ€™t make a firm connection. 
<br>
<h3>What could this information lead to ?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>is this data on state capitals representative of the state overall? (not really)</li>
    <li>are our formulas easily interchangeable to quickly give results on a different ORI set?</li>

</ul>
